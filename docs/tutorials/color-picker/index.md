# Color Picker

#### After completing the 'Hello World' tutorial, you can consider this example as a next step in building custom Alexa skills.

#### This tutorial follows as muchs as 90% of the 'Hello World' base tutorial. The only thing that will change is the ability to work with *Slots*

#### The desired outcome of this skill will be to create the skill in that way in which after invocation, you can tell alexa your favorite color from a list of predefined color values and then you can ask Alexa what is your favorite color. If everything was coded properly, it should remember your color and kindly shout it for you.
