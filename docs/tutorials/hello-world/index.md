# Hello World!

#### This is the most simple example that will get you started with Alexa and AWS lambda in no time. 

#### The desired outcome of this skill will be to create the skill in that way in which after invocation, Alexa will say 'Hello, `your-text-here`'.

#### You can pick the utterances for yourself. Just make sure that you follow the tutorial step-by-step and remember the names that you will associate your invocation and intents. You will need this when you will configure the code on AWS Lambda.
